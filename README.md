Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:  

 Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

Part 1: Decision trees:
- For this section, I will build a model that makes the above prediction using Random forests, Ada boosted trees, and gradient boosted trees.
- I will try and optimize each of the 2 models, making sure to document how i've set up your hyperparameters.
- Identify which of the 2 models i trust most, and use my model to determine which features are most impactful in influencing the prediction
- 
Part 2: SVM:

- In this section, I am required to clean the data a little bit so as to make sense of the features.

- Document what transformation i've done on the data.

- Apply Polynomial, linear and rbf kernel function to build my SVM model and then evaluate their performance and pick the kernel that performs the best. Also i have to tuned my  parameters to improve the performance of my model
